ANSWER 1

• First we Initialise a temporary pointer variable temp equal to the
element next to head pointer.
• Then the temp pointer is made to trace to travel on the linked list
using a while loop.
• The condition establishing that the traversing element/variable has
reached the first element is temp!=head. This condition tells us that
we have reached starting element, i.e.head and that we need to stop
traversing when we satisfy this condition. When temp pointer comes
out of the while loop, then the temp pointer has reached the first
element
• Here we cannot compare the data as the linked list may contain
different elements with same data
• The complete bit of code for this condition is:
• Node*temp=head->next;

 while(temp!=head){
 temp=temp->next;
 }
